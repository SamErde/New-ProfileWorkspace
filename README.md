I think I prefer the table *if* descriptions are being included.

## New-ProfileWorkspace [:top:](#top "Go to the top of the page.")

### Synopsis

Setup a folder and VS Code Workspace for maintaining your PowerShell profiles, VS Code settings, and Windows Terminal settings.

- Script: [New-ProfileWorkspace.ps1](New-ProfileWorkspace.ps1)
- Status: Working :runner:

### Description

I wanted an easy way to maintain all of my CurrentUser PowerShell profiles, and my settings files for Visual Studio Code and Windows Terminal. There are probably easier ways to accomplish this, but my basic goal was to not have to hunt for these files across the file system in order to edit them. This over-engineered idea creates a folder that contains:

- Junction points to the locations of your CurrentUser PowerShell and Windows PowerShell folders
- Junction points to the locations of your settings for VS Code and Windows Terminal
- Structural artifacts in case you want to save this as a repository
  - A Visual Studio Code workspace file that opens this new folder
  - EditorConfig and Visual Studio Code settings files for consistent editing
  - A .gitignore file in case you want to use this as a git repository (test?)

<a name="newdotsourcedprofile"></a><div id='newdotsourcedprofile' />
## New-DotSourcedProfile [:top:](#top)

I need to automate this one still, but it will be a script that creates one central profile script and then sets each CurrentUser profile to dot source that central profile for easier sync across all of your profiles for PowerShell, PowerShell ISE, Visual Studio Code, Windows PowerShell, etc.

<a name='installohmyposh'></a><div id='installohmyposh' />
## Install-OhMyPosh [:top:](#top)

### Synopsis

Install Oh My Posh, or update it if already installed.

- Script: [Install-OhMyPosh.ps1](Install-OhMyPosh.ps1)
- Status: Working :runner:

### Description

This is a quick installer for Oh My Posh. It's almost unnecessary because of how easy OMP is to install, but may be helpful to people who are brand new to it and want to save time. Includes steps to install Nerd Fonts. Nerd Fonts are required to get the most out of Oh My Posh and some great modules like Posh-Git, and Terminal Icons.

<a name="installpowershellise"></a><div id='installpowershellise' />
## Install-PowerShellISE [:top:](#top)

Install the PowerShell ISE if it was removed. It can be helpful to keep the ISE installed for compatibility testing.
